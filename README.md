# Chamfer Distance Computation between point clouds in C++

This work computes the chamfer distance between two point clouds. It depends on PCL and Torch. 

## Installation
### To install PCL:
```bash
$ ./install_pcl.sh
```
### To install Torch:
Follow the instructions on their [website](https://pytorch.org/). For this work Torch 1.3 was used.
```bash
$ wget https://download.pytorch.org/libtorch/cu101/libtorch-cxx11-abi-shared-with-deps-1.3.0.zip
$ unzip libtorch-cxx11-abi-shared-with-deps-1.3.0.zip
```
## Demo
To run the demo:
```bash
$ ./run_chamfer_demo.sh
```
